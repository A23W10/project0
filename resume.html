                                    In the first half of my internship, I was a part of the team that worked on the company's pricing tool project that was aimed at auto-generating invoices for the customers. I was responsible for deriving a formula that calculated the overall price a customer would pay based on the order type, expected delivery date and lead time amongst others. I acquired skills in using JavaScript.
                                    In the second half of my internship I was entrusted with the roles of product designer, product tester and scrum master, where I was responsible for designing the company's customer portal layout, testing the different portal features and ensuring that goals of the project were understood by everyone on the team.

                                    was a part of a team of four that carried out a case study on how to improve the energy efficiency of the lighting system in the production department. From this case study my team and I were able to identify the company's energy consumption per month and suggest the use of LED tube lights rather than Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) to cut down on costs.
