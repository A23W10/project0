My project is a "more than what meets the eye" CV  
Conventionally as a fresh graduate, we are often advised that one's CV length is a crucial factor in determining whether or not you get the job. Which is logically true if you take into consideration that a recruiter has over 50+ CVs to go through in a day, and there’s a chance that at some point they’ll lose concentration. With that taken into account, often one is advised and expected to have a CV that is not more than a page or two long. That would mean that an overachiever would have to summarise or leave out some of their achievements.

My project gives a visualised CV and I decided to break down my "CV" into four webpages as follows;

Home(index.html): 
    Comprises a brief description of me which includes an opening statement (About), interpersonal skills and a summary to wrap it all up

Background(resume.html):
    Comprises my Education and Work background i.e. levels of education, work experience and technical skills

ECA(extras.html):
    Stands for Extra Curricular Activities and comprises the different extra-curricular activities i partcipated in and the different awards received

Gallery(gallery.html):
    Comprises a pictorial of a fraction of my proudest achievements
